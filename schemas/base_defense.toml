### 
# base_defense schema
# Configured to implement a defense based on the class representations on poisoned CIFAR-10.
# Implements three defenses as described in the paper kmeans, pca, and quantum (spectre).
# Inputs the [0-9].npy representations of a trained model on the the classes of CIFAR.
# Outputs the .npy binary poison mask dictating which datapoints are poison and which are not.
