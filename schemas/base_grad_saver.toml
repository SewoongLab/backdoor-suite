### 
# base_grad_saver schema
# Configured to extract gradients from LeNet-1 on poisoned MNIST data.
# Inputs a the .pth of a previously trained model.
# Outputs a two files corresponding to the gradients and MNIST / CIFAR labels.

[base_grad_saver]
input = "string: Path to .pth file."
output = "string: Path to a folder for outputs labelled [0-9].npy"
model = "string: (r18 / r32 / l1). For ResNet-18, ResNet-32, or LeNet-1"
dataset = "string: (cifar / mnist). For CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets"
source_label = "int: {0,1,...,9}. Specifies label to mimic"
target_label = "int: {0,1,...,9}. Specifies label to attack"
poisoner = "string: Form: {0,1,...,9}x{a,b,...,z}. Integer resembles number of attacks and string represents type"
poisons = "int: {0,1,...,infty}. Specifies number of poisons to generate"

[OPTIONAL]
variant = "string: Form: {model}_{hyperparam string}. Represents .npy file to consume from data/ when doing label consistent"
reduce_amplitude = "float: {[0, 1], -1.0}. Specifies amplitude reduction for label consistent. -1.0 if none"
